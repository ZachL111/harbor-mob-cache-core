# harbor-mob-cache-core

`harbor-mob-cache-core` treats mobile workflows as a local verification problem. The Go implementation is intentionally narrow, but the fixtures and notes make the behavior explicit.

## Harbor Mob Cache Core Checkpoints

Treat the compact fixture as the contract and the extended examples as a scratchpad. The code should stay boring enough that a change in behavior is obvious from the test output.

## What This Is For

This is not a wrapper around a service. It is a self-contained project that shows how the model behaves when demand, capacity, latency, risk, and weight move in different directions.

## Useful Pieces

- Models local state with deterministic scoring and explicit review decisions.
- Uses fixture data to keep sync pressure changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for form constraints, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents offline paths tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.

## Architecture Notes

The design is intentionally direct: parse or construct a signal, score it, classify it, and verify the expected branch. This makes the repository useful for studying mobile workflows behavior without needing a service or database unless the language project itself is SQL. The Go layout uses small packages and table-oriented tests so the behavior stays easy to follow.

## Project Layout

- `policy`: Go package with the core model
- `cmd`: small command entry point
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands
- `go.mod`: Go module metadata

## Tooling

The only required setup is the local Go toolchain. After cloning, stay in the repo root so fixture paths resolve correctly.

## Local Workflow

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Quality Gate

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Case Study

`baseline` is the first example I would inspect because it lands on the `review` path with a score of 89. The broader file also keeps `degraded` at -95 and `surge` at 195, which gives the model a useful low-to-high spread.

## Scope

The examples cover useful edges, not every edge. A larger version would add malformed-input tests, richer reports, and deeper domain parsers.

## Expansion Ideas

- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add one more mobile workflows fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.
